This is a primitive disassembler for KS10 microcode.

Build and execute like so:
	make
	./udis < ram.262

By default, microinstructions are disassembled in the order they
appear in memory.  However, by #defining PROGRAM_ORDER in udis.c, the
disassembler will follow the J field.  Also, I've tried to dissassemble
instructions that may be skipped to by means of the SKIP field, though
I'm not sure if I got it right.

The files mcr.262 and ram.262 are the ITS KS10 microcode assembler
listing, and binary RAM file, respectively.  source.262 is the
microcode source code, reconstructed from mcr.262.

There is no support for KL10 microcode, though it should be possible
to add without too much hassle.
